JavaScript is an object-oriented scripting language that has evolved from a means to manipulate static HTML and CSS websites into the backbone of today’s most dynamic and interactive websites. Its popularity has increased in recent years because it has branched from just a browser-based language to numerous development frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue. As a result, there are usually plenty of JavaScript development jobs on the market.
